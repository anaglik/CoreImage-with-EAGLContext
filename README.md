CoreImage-with-EAGLContext

Simple example of drawing manipulated image to CIContext based on EAGLContext. This setup is recomended when applicaion needs Real-Time performance.(image is never copied to CPU memory). 

In this example I am using "CIMaskToAlpha" filter to replace background color of image below with color of main view.
